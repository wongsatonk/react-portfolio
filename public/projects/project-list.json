    "details": "The project involves developing an automated frog farming system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to optimize feeding and water changes while predicting the weight of the frogs. By integrating Arduino Uno R3 for controlling feeding and water systems, and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B for machine learning-based weight prediction, the system provides real-time control and data storage on AWS platforms. This innovation aims to streamline farming operations, offer precise control, and enhance data-driven analysis for future improvements.",
